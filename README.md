# reactive-tkinter

This repository is a tiny playground for trying out reactive ideas in Tkinter.
Some of the scripts started as AI-generated sketches that I later tweaked by hand.
Please treat it as a toy project, not something built for production use.

## TODO
- Implement use_effect
- Import more Tkinter components
- Make the app detect window size changes so state updates reactively
